# Welcome to My Blog

This is an example blog post written in Markdown. The GoBlog framework will automatically render this content and make it available through the blog API.

## Features

This blog supports:

- **Markdown formatting** for easy content creation
- **YAML frontmatter** for metadata
- **Tag-based organization** for easy navigation
- **Dynamic serving** with the GoBlog framework

## Code Example

Here's a simple Go code snippet:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

## What's Next?

Start creating your own blog posts by adding markdown files to the `posts/` directory. Each post should include YAML frontmatter with metadata like title, date, author, and tags.

Happy blogging!
